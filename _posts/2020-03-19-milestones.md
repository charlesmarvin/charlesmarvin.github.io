It's been a while hasn't it... I clearly was not committed to making notes which was clearly a mistake - Six years have past and I don't have a (single versioned controlled) place to look back on how I've evolved as a software practitioner and human. But I've always been motivated by the adage everyday is a new opportunity.


So what have I been up to? Some milestones:

+ Lead a team of 5 Gray Wolves in the build out of Credit Pulse which allows FICC traders and sales people to see near real-time market share
+ Got promoted to Vice President
+ Change roles - moved to the then new consumer division where I was part of the team that launched Marcus by Goldman Sachs
+ After sprinting on the consumer side for 2yrs I decided to rejoin FICC to consolidate some application workflows
+ Got poached to lead a tech team within the GS Accelerate incubator after 11 months in FICC
+ Ran the New York City Marathon not once but 3 times!
+ Grew an impressive beard


I will expand on some of the things I've learnt in subsequent posts.
