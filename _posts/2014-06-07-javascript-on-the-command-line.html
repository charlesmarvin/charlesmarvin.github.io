    I started hacking my solutions to <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> using python but recently decided to do them in JavaScript. I could easily create a simple web page to execute my JavaScript solutions however the lazy developer in me didn't want to. I wanted to run my scripts outside of the context of a web browser.

    A quick search of the interwebs yielded good results. Turns out there are a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Shells">few runtimes</a> out there for executing JavaScript from the command-line. If you are running an OSX Leopard or later you can use the <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JSC">JSC</a> command-line utility. Create a symlink to the executable as follows:    
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/jsc /bin/jsc
{% endhighlight %} 
</p>

<p>
I went with Mozilla's <a html="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Introduction_to_the_JavaScript_shell">SpiderMonkey</a>. The install was simple enough using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:
{% highlight bash %}
$ brew install spidermonkey
{% endhighlight %}  

Once installation is complete you can run the interpreter interactively with the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
$ js
{% endhighlight %} 
Execute a script called solution.js as follows:
{% highlight bash %}
$ js solution.js
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>
    Keep in mind that you are running outside of the context of the browser so as a result functions that are available in the browser may not be available in your JavaScript runtime and vise versa.
