Technical (coding) interviews have been a humbling experience for me to say the least. 
I've been in the workforce for about a decade and haven't interviewed much during this time (not a smart move). 
Truth is taking tests with a stranger evaluating me has always given me an overwhelming sense of anxiety. 
I sweat uncontrollably, my fingers don't work, and my brain is as foggy as the Bay Area at dawn. I am literally unable to think.
This phenomenon is not limited to technical interviews. I still don't have a drivers license because after 2 failed road test attempt I've been not so secretly holding out for driverless cars.

Turns out I have a hyperresponsive fear system. Psychologically every time I get into an interviews my body responds like I've just happened upon a crocodile.
Studies have shown that in this state of stress and your IQ in negatively [citation]. You basically get dumber when under stress if not managed.

Now that I'm looking for new career opportunities outside of the firm I have no choice but to grapple with this impediment.
